# Peer-to-Peer-conversation

Developed a real-time communication application leveraging browser-based Peer Communication technology for establishing peer-to-peer connections. Implemented features such as video/audio calls and text messaging in a decentralized manner, enabling direct communication between users without intermediary servers.

STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers are used in WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) to facilitate peer-to-peer communication between devices across the internet.

Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) configuration which may be used to establish an RTCPeerConnection

ICE candidates serve as addresses that devices use to connect with each other over the internet. A device can have multiple ICE candidates, each containing information such as IP addresses, port numbers, and transport protocols.
