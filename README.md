Developed a real-time communication application leveraging browser-based Peer Communication technology for establishing peer-to-peer connections. Implemented features such as video/audio calls and text messaging in a decentralized manner, enabling direct communication between users without intermediary servers.

STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers are used in WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) to facilitate peer-to-peer communication between devices across the internet.
